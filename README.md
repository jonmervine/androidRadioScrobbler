androidRadioScrobbler
=====================
Future Plan

Load up a shout cast station, point to a radio stream url, or load a .pls file
Begin playing station. Can Stop/Start streaming

Put in last.fm information and allow scrobbling

Be able to set duration for scrobbling (to avoid scrobbling commercials)

Maybe have a smart feature to try and automatically know what is a commercial and what isn't
so that nothing is accidentally scrobbled

Also maybe have a way to configure artist/album/track mappings for last.fm

for instance

ANFO radio would be:
artist - xyz
track - abc (def)
album - 

where (def) is the album. So map it to look like

artist - xyz
track - abc
album - def

Maybe also plug into some different radios API's for different things.  So ANFO has rate songs and favorite songs.
